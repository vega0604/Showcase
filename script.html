            Not sure about you guys, but I found this assignment really difficult. I didn’t find it difficult because of the subject matter, or because collective memory is a difficult course, but actually because of how vague the assignment description is. I generally struggle with assignments that require me to be creative in my writing. I consider myself to be a very practical person, and so creative endeavours daunt me a bit.

            Every time I tried to pick a subject matter or to write anything at all, I found myself coming up with cliches. After a couple days of bashing my head into the wall and crying myself to sleep every night, I was getting understandably frustrated with myself. And with my utter lack of creativity. I realised that this comes from a problem I think we all share, and that’s the fact that we hate being left alone with our thoughts. I mean, we all know the panic we get when we go into the bathroom and forget our phones outside. We don’t really care about the tiktoks we’re watching, we just don’t want to be left alone with ourselves for too long.

            Evolutionary psychologists tell us that there are circuits in the human brain that have evolved specifically for detecting snakes. Snakes were a dangerous predator for mankind for millions of years. Our closest relatives, chimps, have a deep fear of snakes and are very adept at detecting them. Throw a toy snake into the enclosure of a chimp that’s never seen a snake before, and it’s going to jump. Of course, in our comfy modern society, we never really have to deal with snakes, except as pets. Our brains, however, don’t know that. In fact, they use the very same circuit for dealing with things we perceive as threats. And that can be anything from an actual snake, to the rotting pile of undone homework on your desk. And like our rotting pile of undone homework, we stack piles of unattended thoughts in a little corner in our minds. And we use the same circuit for confronting both.

            Our modern lives don’t help either. Society has no shortage of things we can use to distract ourselves further. Social media, TV, mindless consumerism, and a million other things serve as distractions we can use. Whenever we experience any sort of negative emotion, we instinctively go for our phones and start another session of endless scrolling. After reflecting on this for a bit, I realised this is a defining aspect of gen-Z culture. Gen-Z, I think, is a unique generation, because the circumstances we exist in are first-of-their-kind. They are a complete historical novelty. Gen-Z is known for being very polarised, but also very homogeneous, and I believe this tendency to avoid ourselves is one of the catalysts behind this. It’s at the core of a lot of our cultural artefacts, our humour, and our habits. We belittle our thoughts, our feelings, we have an innate tendency to search for something outside of ourselves for answers.

            In my assignment, I chose to discuss this tendency of our generation, and how it relates to the memories we all share. I also wanted to explore the consequences of being with myself, how that relates to the meaning we find in our lives, and how it relates to the human knack for creativity.
